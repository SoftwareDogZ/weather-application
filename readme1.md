Create the Bean Class
=====================
In order to analyze the .json file, I created a class named WeatherBean through GsonFormat Tool.

Step1:
------
Open "File->Project Structure->Dependences" and add the "com.google.code.gson:gson:2.8.5" into the project

Step3:

Create a Java Class and name it WeatherBean. Put the cursor in the class and press Alt+S and paste the example .json file into the textbox. Click "OK" then the WeatherBean Class will be created for us.
